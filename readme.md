# Exploring AI Through Visionary-Labs: A Face Recognition Demo

In my journey through the world of AI, I’ve always been fascinated by the potential of visual recognition systems. While diving deeper into various AI subfields, I embarked on a small demo project to explore the basics of face recognition—an area that blends computer vision, machine learning, and real-time interactions. This demo project, titled Visionary-Labs: Face Recognition, is not a fully polished product but an experimental setup where I explore face detection, recognition, and interaction using a camera feed.

This project is part of my ongoing exploration of AI. I hope to continue experimenting, learning, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible—one small project at a time.
